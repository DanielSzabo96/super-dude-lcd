This is an Arduino Project of a simple Super - Mario style game,
made by Daniel Szabo.

The Buzzer sounds were made by me and are free to use.

The inputs are MUSIC_BOX (set to digital 3)
and JoyX (set to digital 2) user can change the inputs on the board as they like, 
but should change their definitions in the preprocesor.
